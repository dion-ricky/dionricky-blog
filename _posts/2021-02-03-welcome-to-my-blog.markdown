This blog is NOT a source to learn stuff from. I'm still learning and I sometimes wrote here to document my learning journey. And since I'm still learning, there are lots of knowledge gaps and probably mistakes and errors on my posts.

If you want to give a feedback, you can reach out to me through my [email][send-mail]. But if you want to contribute directly, feel free to create a pull request [here][gh-dionricky-blog].

Thank you for visiting my blog. I hope you enjoyed it.
